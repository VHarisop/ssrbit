# A small library for Bit Sequences

This is a preliminary library for handling modular arithmetic of bit
sequences.

See the main file for documentation.

## References

This library was started after reading the paper:

> From Sets to Bits in Coq
> Arthur Blot, Pierre-Evariste Dagand, Julia Lawall

however it takes some different implementation decisions. Some other
